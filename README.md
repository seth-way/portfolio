## Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This app is meant to help any developer easily showcase their work.

## Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

## Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

> [!WARNING]
> **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) & [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are required to run this app.**<br>
> _Please ensure you have both installed on your machine before proceeding._

- _(optional) *Fork this project to your own Github account._
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- `cd` into the project folder.
- Use the `npm install` command to install the project dependencies.
- Use the `npm run dev` command to run a preview version of the app.
- Check the console for the `PORT` & copy/paste `localhost:PORT` into your web browser.
- If you would like to work with your own version of the API, fork [this repo](https://github.com/seth-way/degs-o-kev-bacon-api) & follow the instructions in the README.

## Customize for You!
- To personalize this app's content for yourself, replace the info in `src/assets/resume-info/`.
- Be sure to maintain the json's format white editting.
- All project preview GIFs should be placed in `src/assets/images/projects/`
  - Their basename should share the `"short"` attribute from the project's info in `src/assets/resume-info/projects`.
- To create new tech badges, add them to `src/assets/resume-info/badges.json`.
  - I only used badges from this [site](https://dev.to/envoy_/150-badges-for-github-pnk). If you use your own, it may require a small refactor.

## Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This portfolio was a solo, side project project completed during my 5th month at Turing. I spent roughly 20 hours writing the application.

## Contributors:
