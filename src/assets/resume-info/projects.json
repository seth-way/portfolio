    "description": "A sleek UI built using React & designed to challenge users on their knowledge of movie trivia. Using an input device or a touchscreen, a user can drag & drop movies or movie stars while trying to create a valid puzzle. A puzzle is only valid if a star is between 2 movies they starred in vice versa.",

      "The game ties together several new concepts I wasn't sure I could pull off. My idea required using a drag-n-drop interface, creating SVG paths to clip images to various shapes & using framer-motion to create smooth animations. All these new concepts came together nicely & I'm happy with the final UI.",
      "The app's various pieces of state became cumbersome to work with & so I made a decision to refactor all state to use a ZuStand store. It took time away from developing new features, but overall it was worth it. After the refactor, managing state became much more cut & dry. Most importantly, I was able to work with a useful new library in the process.",
      "The DnD-Kit Library comes with several useful new hooks. However, my use case was unique & so finding relevant examples was an issue. It required patience, trial & error & lots of debugging to integrate into my app.",
      "Cypress's drag-n-drop tools did not natively work with my chosen library, so that also took some research. I was able to find a useful 3rd party library that made it possible to use DnD-Kit with Cypress's testing suite."
